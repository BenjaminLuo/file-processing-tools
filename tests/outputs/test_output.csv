Introduc tion\nThe scope o f this teaching package is to  make a brief induction to Artifici al Neur al\nNetworks (ANNs)   for peo ple who have  no prev ious knowledge o f them. W e first make a  brief\nintroduction to mo dels o f networks,  for then descr ibing in general  terms ANNs. As a n\napplicatio n, we explai n the backpropagatio n algor ithm, since i t is widely used and many other\nalgor ithms are  deriv ed from i t. \nThe user s hould know algebr a and the handling of funct ions and vectors . Differentia l\ncalculus i s recomme ndable, but not necessar y. The contents of th is package  should be\nunderstoo d by p eople with high scho ol education. It woul d be useful fo r peo ple who are  just\ncurio us abo ut what a re ANNs, or for people  who want to beco me fami liar with th em, so  when\nthey study th em m ore fully, they will already have clear notions of AN Ns. Also, people w ho\nonly want to apply the bac kpropagation a lgorithm without a detailed  and formal  explanation\nof it will find this material  useful. Th is work  should not  be seen as “Net s for d ummies ”, but of\ncourse  it is not a treatis e. Much of the formal ity is skipped for  the sake o f simplici ty. D etailed\nexplanations and demonstrations can be found in the referred readings. The included exercises\ncomplem ent the und erstanding of th e theor y. The on-line reso urces are hi ghly  recomme nded\nfor extending th is brief induction.\n2. Networ ks\nOne efficient wa y of solving complex problems is following th e lemma “divide and\nconquer ”. A complex  system may be decompos ed into simple r elements, in order t o be able\nto understand it. Also s imple elements may be gathered to pro duce a comple x system (B ar\nYam, 1997). Networks are on e ap proach  for achievin g this. There are a l arge nu mber of\ndifferent typ es of networks, but they all are characteri zed by the follo wing components: a s et\nof nodes , and connections be tween nodes.\nThe nodes can be seen as co mputational units. They rece ive inputs, and p rocess them\nto obt ain an output. This processing might be ver y simp le (such as summi ng the inputs), or\nquite com plex (a  node mi ght c ontain ano ther network...)\nThe connections de termine  the informa tion flow between nodes . They can be\nunidirectional, when the information flows only in one sense, and bidirectional, when the\ninform ation flo ws in either  sense .\nThe interactions of nodes though the connect ions lead to a global behaviour of the\nnetwork, which cannot be obs erved in the ele ments of the network. This glo bal be havio ur is\nsaid to be emergent . This means that the abilities of the  network supercede the ones of its\nelements, maki ng netw orks a ve ry powerful too l.Networks ar e use d to model a  wide range  of phenome na in p hysics, computer sci ence,\nbiochemistry, ethology, mathematics, sociology, economics, telecommunications, and m any\nother areas. This is because  many s ystems can be seen as a network:  protei ns, computers,\ncommunities, etc. Which other systems could you see as a network? Why?\n3. Artificial neur al networks\nOne typ e of network see s the nodes a s ‘artificia l neuro ns’. These are called ar tificial\nneural networks (ANNs). An artificial neuron is a computational model inspired in the\nnatural neurons. Natu ral neurons receive signals through synapses located on the dendrites\nor m embr ane o f the neuron. Whe n the signals  rece ived are s trong enough (sur pass a ce rtain\nthreshold), the neuro n is activated and emits a  signal though the axon . This signal  might be\nsent to another s ynapse, and might activate o ther neuro ns.\nFigure 1. N atura l neuron s (artist’s conception).\nThe complex ity of rea l neuro ns is h ighly abstracted w hen model ling artifi cial\nneurons. The se basically consist of inputs (like synapses), which are multiplied by weights\n(strength  of the  respective signals), and then co mpu ted by a mathematical function whi ch\ndetermi nes the activatio n of the  neuron. A nother function (which m ay be the identity)\ncomputes the output  of the artifi cial ne uron (sometime s in dependance o f a certai n\nthreshold). ANN s combine artificial neurons in order to process information.\nFigure 2. A n artificial neuronThe higher a wei ght of an artifici al neuron is, the stro nger the input w hich is\nmultiplie d by it will be . We ights can also  be negative , so we ca n say that t he signal  is\ninhibited by the negative w eight. Depending on the  weights, the computation of t he neuron\nwill be different. By adjusting th e weights of an artificial neuron we  can obtain the  outpu t\nwe want for specific in puts. But when we have a n ANN of h undreds or t housands of\nneuro ns, it would be quite com plicated to find by hand all the neces sary weights. But we can\nfind algori thms wh ich can adjust t he weights o f the  ANN in order  to obtai n the desire d\noutpu t from the  network. Thi s pro cess of adju sting the  weights is called learning  or traini ng.\nThe number o f types of ANNs and thei r uses  is very high. Sinc e the first neural\nmodel by McC ulloch and P itts (1943) there have been de veloped hu ndreds of different\nmodel s consi dered as  ANNs. The difference s in them might be the funct ions, the accepted\nvalue s, the topolo gy, the lea rning algo rithms, e tc. Also there are many  hybrid model s where\neach neuro n has mor e pro perties  than t he on es we a re reviewing here . Beca use o f matters\nof space, we will present onl y an ANN  which learns using th e backpropagation algorithm\n(Rumelh art and Mc Clelland, 198 6) for l earn ing the appropriate weights, since it is on e of\nthe most common models used in AN Ns, and many others are based on it.\nSince the function of ANN s is to process information, they are used ma inly in fields\nrelated wit h it. There  are a wide va riety of ANNs that are used to mo del re al neur al\nnetworks,  and study behavio ur and control in anima ls and machine s, but also  there ar e\nANN s which are used for engineering purposes, such as pattern recognition, forecasting,\nand data compression.\n3.1. Exer cise\nThis exercise is to be come familiar with artificial neural network concepts. Build a\nnetwork consi sting of four a rtificia l neuro ns. Two neuro ns receive inputs to the network,\nand the other two give o utpu ts from the networ k.\nThere are wei ghts assigned with each arrow, wh ich represent information flow.\nThese w eights are m ultiplied by the valu es whic h go th roug h each  arrow , to give m ore orless strength t o the si gnal which th ey transmi t. The neurons o f this network just sum th eir\ninputs. Sin ce the input neurons hav e only one i nput , their o utpu t will be the input th ey\nreceived multiplied by a weight. What happens i f this weight is negative ? What happens if\nthis weight is zero?\nThe neuron s on the output  layer r eceive the outputs of both input n euro ns,\nmultiplie d by t heir respective wei ghts, and sum them. They give an o utpu t wh ich is\nmultiplied by another weight.\nNow , set all the weights to be eq ual to one. T his mean s that the informat ion w ill flow\nunaffected. Compute th e outpu ts of the network fo r the following inputs: (1,1), (1,0) , (0,1),\n(0,0), ( -1,1), (-1,-1) . \nGood.Now, choose weights among 0.5, 0, and -0.5, and set them randomly along th e\nnetwork. Compute t he outp uts for th e same in puts as abov e. Change so me wei ghts and see\nhow the  behaviour of the networks changes. Which we ights are more critical (if you change\nthose weights, t he output s will change more drama tically)?\nNow, suppo se we want a network like the one we are working wi th, such th at the\noutputs should be the inputs in inverse or der (e.g. (0.3,0.7)-> (0.7,0.3)) .\nThat was an easy one! Ano ther easy network would be one where the outputs should\nbe the double  of the inputs.\nNow , let’s set thresholds to the neurons. This is, if the previou s output of the neuron\n(weighted sum of the inp uts) is greater tha n the  threshold of the neu ron, the  outpu t of the\nneuro n will be one, and zero o therwise. Set thre sholds to a  couple o f the alrea dy developed\nnetworks, and see  how this affects their be haviour.\nNow , suppose w e have a n etwork which will receive f or in puts only zeroes a nd/or\nones. Adju st the weights and thr esholds of the neurons so that the outpu t of the first outpu t\nneuro n will be the co njun ction (AND) of the ne twork inputs (one when both inputs are\none, zero ot herwise), and the ou tput of the sec ond output neuron will be the disjunction\n(OR) o f the netw ork i nput s (zero in both inputs are zer oes, one  otherwise ). You can se e\nthat the re is more than one network which w ill give the requested result.\nNow, perhaps it is not so complica ted to  adjust t he weights of such a sma ll network,\nbut also the capabilities of this are quite limited. If we need a network of hundreds of\nneuro ns, how wou ld you adjust t he weights to o btain the desir ed output? Th ere are\nmethods for  finding th em, and now we will e xpose  the most commo n one.\n4. The Bac kpropagation Al gorithm\nThe backpropaga tion algo rithm (Rum elhart and McC lelland, 1986)  is use d in\nlayere d feed-forward ANNs. This me ans that the artifici al neur ons are orga nized in layer s,\nand send th eir signals “forward”, and the n the errors are propagated ba ckwards. The\nnetwork re ceives input s by neurons i n the input layer, and the output of the ne twork is giv en\nby th e neurons on an output layer. There may be one or more intermediate hidden layers .\nThe backpropagation algorithm uses supervised learning, which m eans that we provide the\nalgorithm with examples of the  inputs and o utputs  we want the  network to compu te, and\nthen the error (d ifferen ce between actual and expected results) is calculated. The idea of\nthe backpropagation algorithm is to reduce this error, unti l the ANN  learns  the training\ndata. The training begins with random we ights, and the  goal is to adjust the m so that the\nerror wil l be mi nimal. \nThis formula can be interpreted in the fo llowing way:  the adjustment of each we ight\nji()w) will be  the negative o f a constant eta ( 0) multiplied by t he dependance of the\niprevious weight on the error of the network, which is the derivative of E in respect to w .\nThe size of the  adjustment wi ll depend o n 0, and on the co ntribution of th e weight to  the\nerror of the fun ction. This is , if the weight contri butes a lot to the error , the adjustment w ill\nbe greater than if it contributes in a smaller amount. (5) is used un til we find appropriate\nweigh ts (the error is mini mal) . If you do not know deri vativ es, don’t worr y, you can see\nthem now  as functions that we will replace righ t away with algebra ic ex pression s. If you\nunderstand de rivatives, derive the expressions yourself and compare your results with the\nones  presen ted here. If you ar e sear ching for a mat hematical proof of the backpropagation\nalgorithm, you are advised to check it in the  suggested reading, since this is out of the  scope\nof this mater ial.\njiSo, we “only” ne ed to find the derivative of E in respect to w. This is the goal of the\nbackpropagation algorithm, since we need to achieve this backwards. First, we need to\ncalculate how mu ch th e error depends on the  outpu t, wh ich is the derivative of E in respect\njto O  (fro m (3)) .\n(6)\nAnd then, how mu ch the outpu t depends on the  activation, which in tur n depends\non the weights (from  (1) a nd (2)):\n(7)\nAnd w e can se e that (from ( 6) and (7) ):\n(8)\nAnd so, the adjustment t o each weight will be  (fro m (5) a nd (8)):\n(9)\nWe can use (9) as it is for training an ANN w ith two  layers. Now, for training th e\nnetwo rk with one more layer we need to make some considerations. If we want to adjust\nikthe w eights (let’ s call th em v ) of a previou s layer, we need  first to cal culate how  the error\ndepends not on the weight, but in the input f rom the previ ous la yer. This i s easy, we would\nij ijust need to change x with w in (7), (8), and (9). But we also nee d to see h ow the error of\nikthe network d epends on the adjustment of v . So:(10)\nWher e:\n(11)\nki kAnd, assuming that t here  are inputs u  into the neuro n with v  (fro m (7)) :\n(12)\nIf we want to add yet another layer, w e can do the same,  calculating how  the error\ndepends on the  inputs and we ights of the  first layer. We should jus t be careful with the\nindexes,  since ea ch layer can have a d ifferent  number of neu rons, and we should not\nconfuse them.\nFor practical reas ons, ANNs imp lemen ting the backpropagation a lgorithm do n ot\nhave too man y layers, since the tim e for trainin g the networks grows exp onen tially. Also,\nthere are refinements to the backpropagation algorithm which allow a faster learning.\n4.1. Exer cise\nIf you know h ow to program, implement the backpropagatio n algor ithm, that at  least\nwill train the  following n etwork. If yo u can do  a g eneral impl ementation of the\nbackpropaga tion algo rithm, go ahead (for any number of neuro ns per layer, training se ts,\nand eve n layers) .\nIf you do not know ho w to program, but know how to use a mathematical assistant\n(such as Matlab o r Mathematica) , find wei ghts which will  suit the follo wing netw ork a fter\ndefining funct ions which w ill ease your task.\nIf you do  not have any compu ting experience, find th e weights by h and.\nThe network for this exercise  has three  neuro ns in the i nput  layer, two neur ons i n\na hidden layer, and three neurons in the output layer. Usually networks are trained with\nlarge training sets, but fo r this exercise, we will only use one training example. When the\ninputs are ( 1, 0.25, -0.5), the ou tputs should be ( 1,-1,0).

A constitutional monarchy, the Crown assumes distinct roles: the executive, as the Crown-in-Council; the legislative, as the Crown-in-Parliament; and the judicial, as the Crown-on-the-Bench.[3][4][5] Three institutions—the Privy Council (conventionally, the Cabinet), the Parliament, and the judiciary, respectively—exercise the powers of the Crown.\n\nThe term Government of Canada (French: Gouvernement du Canada) refers specifically to the executive, which includes ministers of the Crown (together in the Cabinet) and the federal civil service (whom the Cabinet direct); what is formally known as His Majesty's Government (French: Gouvernement de Sa Majesté)[6][7][8][9] and is corporately branded as the Government of Canada. There are over 100 departments and agencies, as well as over 300,000 persons employed in the Government of Canada. These institutions carry out the programs and enforce the laws established by the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe federal government's organization and structure was established at Confederation, through the Constitution Act, 1867, wherein the Canadian Crown acts as the core, or \""the most basic building block\"",[10] of its Westminster-style parliamentary democracy.[11] The monarch, King Charles III, is personally represented by a governor general (currently Mary Simon) and is head of state. A prime minister (currently Justin Trudeau) is the head of government, who is invited by the Crown to form a government after securing the confidence of the House of Commons, which is typically determined through the election of enough members of a single political party in a federal election to provide a majority of seats in Parliament, forming a governing party. Further elements of governance are outlined in the rest of the Canadian constitution, which includes written statutes in addition to court rulings and unwritten conventions developed over centuries.[12]\n\nConstitutionally, the King's Privy Council for Canada is the body that advises the sovereign or their representative on the exercise of executive power. This task is nearly exclusively by the Cabinet, a committee within the Privy Council that sets the government's policies and priorities for the country[13] and is chaired by the prime minister. The sovereign appoints the members of Cabinet on the advice of the prime minister who, by convention, are selected from the House of Commons or, less often, the Senate. During its term, the government must retain the confidence of the House of Commons and certain important motions, such as money bills and the speech from the throne, are considered as confidence motions. Laws are formed by the passage of bills through Parliament, which are either sponsored by the government or individual members of Parliament. Once a bill has been approved by both the House of Commons and the Senate, royal assent is required to make the bill become law. The laws are then the responsibility of the government to oversee and enforce.\n\nTerminology\nUnder Canada's Westminster-style parliamentary democracy, the terms government and Government of Canada refer specifically to the prime minister, Cabinet, and other members of the governing party inside the House of Commons, but typically includes the federal public service and federal departments and agencies when used elsewhere.[14] This differs from the United States, where the executive branch is referred to as an administration and the federal government encompasses executive, legislative, and judicial powers, similar to the Canadian Crown.\n\nIn press releases issued by federal departments, the government has sometimes been referred to as the current prime minister's government (e.g. the Trudeau Government). This terminology has been commonly employed in the media.[15] In late 2010, an informal instruction from the Office of the Prime Minister urged government departments to consistently use, in all department communications, such phrasing (i.e., Harper Government, at the time), in place of Government of Canada.[16] The same Cabinet earlier directed its press department to use the phrase Canada's New Government.[15]\n\nMonarchy\nMain articles: Monarchy of Canada and Governor General of Canada\nSee also: Commander-in-Chief of Canada\n\nCharles III, King of Canada, the country's head of state\n\nMary Simon, Governor General of Canada, the monarch's representative\nThe function of constitutional monarchy is to personify the democratic state, to sanction legitimate authority, to assure the legality of means, and guarantee the execution of the public will. It is my ardent desire that no citizen in my realms should suffer restraint.[17]\n\nElizabeth II, Queen of Canada, Quebec City, 1964\nCanada is a constitutional monarchy, wherein the role of the reigning sovereign is both legal and practical, but not political.[18] The monarch is vested with all powers of state[19] and sits at the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority.[20][21][22][23] The executive is thus formally referred to as the King-in-Council, the legislature as the King-in-Parliament, and the courts as the King-on-the-Bench.[4]\n\nThough the person who is monarch of Canada (currently Charles III) is also the monarch of 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, he nevertheless reigns separately as King of Canada, an office that is \""truly Canadian\"" and \""totally independent from that of the monarch of the United Kingdom or the other Commonwealth realms.\""[24][25] On the advice of the Canadian prime minister, the sovereign appoints a federal viceregal representative—the governor general (currently Mary Simon)—who, since 1947, is permitted to exercise almost all of the monarch's royal prerogative; though, there are some duties which must be specifically performed by the monarch themselves (such as assent of certain bills). In case of the governor general's absence or incapacitation, the administrator of Canada performs the Crown's most basic functions.\n\nRoyal assent is required to enact laws. As part of the royal prerogative, the royal sign-manual gives authority to letters patent and orders-in-Council. Much of the royal prerogative is only exercised in-council, on the advice of the Cabinet;[26][27] within the conventional stipulations of a constitutional monarchy, the sovereign's direct participation in any of these areas of governance is limited.[28][29] The royal prerogative also includes summoning, proroguing, and dissolving Parliament in order to call an election and extends to foreign affairs, which include the negotiation and ratification of treaties, alliances, international agreements, and declarations of war;[30] the accreditation of Canadian diplomats and receipt of foreign diplomats; and the issuance of passports.[31]\n\nExecutive power\n\n\nThe Government of Canada signature (above) and wordmark (below); used to corporately identify the government under the Federal Identity Program\nThe executive power is vested in the Crown and exercised \""in-Council\"", meaning on the advice of the Privy Council; conventionally, this is the Cabinet, which is chaired by the prime minister and comprises ministers of the Crown. The term Government of Canada, or more formally, His Majesty's Government refers to the activities of the King-in-Council. The day-to-day operation and activities of the Government of Canada are performed by the federal departments and agencies, staffed by the Public Service of Canada, and the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\nPrime minister\nMain article: Prime Minister of Canada\n\nJustin Trudeau, Prime Minister and head of government\nOne of the main duties of the Crown is to ensure that a democratic government is always in place,[32] which includes the appointment of a prime minister, who heads the Cabinet and directs the activities of the government.[33] Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists in long-established convention, which stipulates the Crown must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons, who, in practice, is typically the leader of the political party that holds more seats than any other party in that chamber (currently the Liberal Party, led by Justin Trudeau). Should no particular party hold a majority in the House of Commons, the leader of one party—either the party with the most seats or one supported by other parties—will be called by the governor general to form a minority government. Once sworn in, the prime minister holds office until their resignation or removal by the governor general, after either a motion of no confidence or defeat in a general election.[34]\n\nPrivy Council\nMain article: King's Privy Council for Canada\nThe executive is defined in the Constitution Act, 1867 as the Crown acting on the advice of the Privy Council for Canada, referred to as the King-in-Council.[7][35][36][37] However, the Privy Council—consisting mostly of former ministers, chief justices, and other elder statesmen—rarely meets in full. In the construct of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, the advice tendered is typically binding,[38] meaning the monarch reigns but does not rule, with the Cabinet ruling \""in trust\"" for the monarch.[39] However, the royal prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers.[40][41][42]\n\nCabinet\nMain article: Cabinet of Canada\nThe stipulations of responsible government require that those who directly advise the Crown on the exercise the royal prerogative be accountable to the elected House of Commons and the day-to-day operation of government is guided only by a sub-group of the Privy Council made up of individuals who hold seats in Parliament, known as the Cabinet.[37]\n\nThe monarch and governor general typically follow the near-binding advice of their ministers. The royal prerogative, however, belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers,[23][42] who only rule \""in trust\"" for the monarch and who must relinquish the Crown's power back to it upon losing the confidence of the commons,[39][43] whereupon a new government, which can hold the lower chamber's confidence, is installed by the governor general. The royal and vice-royal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations (an exercise of the reserve powers),[n 1] thereby allowing the monarch to make sure \""that the government conducts itself in compliance with the constitution.\""[44] Politicians can sometimes try to use to their favour the complexity of the relationship between the monarch, viceroy, ministers, and Parliament, as well as the public's general unfamiliarity with such.[n 2]\n\nLegislative power\nMain article: Parliament of Canada\nSee also: King-in-Parliament\n\nThe Centre Block of the Parliament buildings on Parliament Hill\nThe Parliament of Canada (French: Parlement du Canada), defined section 17 of the Constitution Act, 1867 is the federal legislature. It is bicameral in nature and comprises two chambers—the elected House of Commons (lower house), and the Senate of Canada (upper house), whose membership is nominated by prime ministers[45][46]—and the King-in-Parliament, who grants royal assent to bills passed by both chambers.\n\nA parliamentary session lasts until a prorogation, after which, without ceremony, both chambers of the legislature cease all legislative business until the governor general issues another royal proclamation calling for a new session to begin. A session begins with a speech from the throne, whereby the governor general or the monarch delivers the governing party's prepared speech of their intentions for the session. After a number of such sessions, each parliament comes to an end via dissolution. Since a general election will typically follow, the timing of a dissolution is usually politically motivated, with the prime minister selecting a moment most advantageous to his or her political party. However, the end of session may also be necessary if the majority of the House of Commons revoke their confidence in the prime minister's ability to govern, such as through a vote of no-confidence or if the government's budget is voted down (a loss of supply). While the Canada Elections Act mandates that members of Parliament stand for election a minimum of every four-years, no session has ever been allowed to expire in such a fashion.\n\nRole of the Crown\nThe Crown does not participate in the legislative process save for signifying approval to a bill passed by both chambers of Parliament, known as the granting of royal assent, which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law. All federal bills thus begin with the phrase:[47]\n\n\""Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows ...\""\n\nMembers of the two chambers of Parliament must also express their loyalty to the Crown and thus to Canada by reciting the Oath of Allegiance, which must be sworn by all new parliamentarians before they may take their seats. Further, the Official Opposition is formally termed His Majesty's Loyal Opposition, to signify that, though they may be opposed to the incumbent Cabinet's policies, they remain dedicated to the apolitical Crown.[48][49]\n\nHouse of Commons\nAs a democratic tradition, the elected House of Commons (French: Chambre des communes), while the lower house, is the dominant branch of Parliament and, as such, the Senate and Crown rarely oppose its will. Any spending bill must originate in the House of Commons and the prime minister holds office by virtue of commanding its confidence. The 338 members of the House of Commons, known as members of Parliament (MPs) are directly elected by Canadian citizens, with each member representing a single electoral district for a period mandated by the Canada Elections Act of no more than four years[50] (though the Charter of Rights and Freedoms mandates a maximum of five years).\n\nMembers of the governing party sit on the government benches, located on the speaker's right and members of the opposition parties on the left, with the Cabinet of Canada and prime minister, and shadow cabinet and leader of the Opposition across from one another (known as frontbenchers).[51]\n\nSenate\nThe upper house of the Parliament of Canada, the Senate (French: Sénat), is a group of 105 individuals appointed by the Crown on the advice of the prime minister.[52] Appointees must be a minimum of 30 years old, be a subject of the monarch, and own property with a net worth of at least $4,000, in addition to owning land worth no less than $4,000 within the province they represent.[53] Senators serve until a mandatory retirement age of 75.\n\nThe principle underlying the Senate's composition is equality amongst Canada's geographic regions: 24 for Ontario, 24 for Quebec, 24 for the Maritimes (10 for Nova Scotia, 10 for New Brunswick, and four for Prince Edward Island), and 24 for the Western provinces (six each for Manitoba, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta).[54] Additionally, senators are appointed from two geographic areas not part of any senatorial division. Newfoundland and Labrador (since 1949 the \""newest\"" province, although \""oldest\"" English settlement), is represented by six senators. Since 1975 each of Canada's territories is represented by 1 senator—the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and (since its formation in 1999) Nunavut.\n\nJudicial\nMain article: Court system of Canada\nSee also: Supreme Court Act\n\nSupreme Court Building in Ottawa\nThe Crown is responsible for rendering justice and is thus traditionally deemed the fount of justice.[55] However, the monarch does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the royal prerogative are performed in trust and in the Crown's name by officers of the judicial system.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada—the country's court of last resort—has nine justices appointed by the governor general on recommendation by the prime minister and led by the chief justice of Canada, and hears appeals from decisions rendered by the various appellate courts (provincial, territorial, and federal).\n\nThe Federal Court hears cases arising under certain areas of federal law,[56] and works in conjunction with the Tax Court of Canada.[57]\n\nFederalism\nMain article: Canadian federalism\nThe powers of the parliaments in Canada are limited by the Constitution, which divides legislative abilities between the federal and provincial governments. In general, the provincial legislatures may only pass laws relating to topics explicitly reserved for them by the constitution, such as education, provincial officers, municipal government, charitable institutions, and \""matters of a merely local or private nature,\""[58] whereas any matter not under the exclusive authority of the provincial legislatures is within the scope of the federal parliament's power.\n\nThus, the federal Parliament alone can pass laws relating to, amongst other things, Canada's postal service, census, military, criminal law, navigation and shipping, fishing, currency, banking, weights and measures, bankruptcy, copyrights, patents, First Nations, and naturalization.[59]\n\nIn some cases, federal and provincial jurisdictions may be more vague. For instance, the federal parliament regulates marriage and divorce in general, while the solemnization of marriage is regulated only by provincial legislatures. Other examples include the powers of both the federal and provincial parliaments to impose taxes, borrow money, punish crimes, and regulate agriculture.\n\nPolitical culture\nMain article: Political culture of Canada\nFurther information: Monarchy of Canada § Public understanding\n\nA copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\nAn emphasis on liberalism[60] and social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[61] Individual rights, equality, and inclusiveness (i.e. a just society) have risen to the forefront of political and legal importance for most Canadians, as demonstrated through: support for the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;[62] a relatively free economy; and social liberal attitudes toward women's rights, homosexuality, abortion rights, euthanasia, cannabis use, and other egalitarian movements.[63][64][65][62] Likewise, there is a sense of collective responsibility in Canadian political culture, as is demonstrated in general support for universal health care, multiculturalism, foreign aid, and other social programs.[66][67][68][69] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an implied bill of rights are founding principles of the Canadian government.[70][71]\n\nAt the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising \""brokerage politics:\""[a] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors).[74][75][76][77][78][79] In the Canadian political spectrum, the historically predominant Liberals have positioned themselves more-or-less at the centre, with Conservatives sitting to their right and New Democrats occupying the further left.[80][81][82] Smaller parties, such as the Green Party of Canada and the Quebec-nationalist Bloc Québécois, have also been able to exert their influence over the political process by representation at the federal level. Far-right and far-left politics, in terms of Canadian politics, have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.[83][84]\n\nPolls have suggested that Canadians generally do not have a solid understanding of civics.[85] This has been theorized to be a result of less attention being given to the subject in provincial education curricula, beginning in the 1960s.[86] By 2008, a poll showed only 24 per cent of respondents could name the monarch as head of state.[87] Likewise, Senator Lowell Murray wrote five years earlier that \""the Crown has become irrelevant to most Canadians' understanding of our system of Government.\""[88] As John Robson of the National Post opined in 2015: \""Intellectually, voters and commentators succumb to the mistaken notion that we elect 'governments' of prime ministers and cabinets with untrammelled authority, that indeed ideal 'democracy' consists precisely in this kind of plebiscitary autocracy.\""[89]\n\nSee also\nflag\tCanada portal\nStructure of the Canadian federal government\nHis Majesty's Government (term)\nCanadian order of precedence\nOffice-holders of Canada\nPublic Service of Canada\n.gc.ca\nReferences\nNotes\n \""Brokerage politics\"": A Canadian term for successful big tent parties that embody a pluralistic catch-all approach to appeal to the median Canadian voter ... adopting centrist policies and electoral coalitions to satisfy the short-term preferences of a majority of electors who are not located on the ideological fringe.[72][73]\n See 'Responsibilities' and Note 1 at Cabinet of Canada.\n It was said by Helen Forsey: \""The inherent complexity and subtlety of this type of constitutional situation can make it hard for the general public to fully grasp the implications. That confusion gives an unscrupulous government plenty of opportunity to oversimplify and misrepresent, making much of the alleged conflict between popular democracy—supposedly embodied in the Prime Minister—and the constitutional mechanisms at the heart of responsible government, notably the 'reserve powers' of the Crown, which gets portrayed as illegitimate.\"" As examples, she cited the campaign of William Lyon Mackenzie King following the King–Byng Affair of 1926 and Stephen Harper's comments during the 2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute.[18]\nCitations\n \""An inside look at the new House of Commons\"".

The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts subordinate to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nNaming\n\nA diagram of the political system of the United States\nThe full name of the republic is \""United States of America\"". No other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party. The terms \""Government of the United States of America\"" or \""United States Government\"" are often used in official documents to represent the federal government as distinct from the states collectively.\n\nIn casual conversation or writing, the term \""Federal Government\"" is often used, and the term \""National Government\"" is sometimes used. The terms \""Federal\"" and \""National\"" in government agency or program names generally indicate affiliation with the federal government; for instance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service. Because the seat of government is in Washington, D.C., \""Washington\"" is sometimes used as a metonym for the federal government.\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of the United States government\nThe United States government is based on the principles of federalism and republicanism, in which power is shared between the national government and state governments. The interpretation and execution of these principles, including what powers the federal government should have and how those powers can be exercised, have been debated ever since the adoption of the Constitution. Some make a case for expansive federal powers while others argue for a more limited role for the central government in relation to individuals, the states, or other recognized entities.\n\nSince the American Civil War, the powers of the federal government have generally expanded greatly, although there have been periods since that time of legislative branch dominance (e.g., the decades immediately following the Civil War) or when states' rights proponents have succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action, executive prerogative or by a constitutional interpretation by the courts.[2][3]\n\nOne of the theoretical pillars of the U.S. Constitution is the idea of \""checks and balances\"" among the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of American government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. For example, while the legislative branch (Congress) has the power to create law, the executive branch under the president can veto any legislation—an act which, in turn, can be overridden by Congress.[4] The president nominates judges to the nation's highest judiciary authority, the Supreme Court, but those nominees must be approved by Congress. The Supreme Court, in turn, can invalidate unconstitutional laws passed by the Congress. These and other examples are examined in more detail in the text below.\n\nLegislative branch\nMain article: United States Congress\n\nSeal of the United States Congress\nThe United States Congress, under Article I of the Constitution, is the legislative branch of the federal government. It is bicameral, comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nMakeup of Congress\nHouse of Representatives\n\nThe 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives grouped by state\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is made up of 435 voting members, each of whom represents a congressional district in a state from where they were elected. Apportionment of seats among the 50 states is determined by state populations, and it is updated after each decennial U.S. Census. Each member serves a two-year term.\n\nIn order to be elected as a representative, an individual must be at least 25 years of age, must have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and must live in the state that they represent.\n\nIn addition to the 435 voting members, there are six non-voting members, consisting of five delegates and one resident commissioner. There is one delegate each from Washington, D.C., Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and a resident commissioner from Puerto Rico.[5]\n\nUnlike the U.S. Senate, all members of the U.S. House must be elected and cannot be appointed. In the case of a vacancy, the seat must be filled through a special election, as required under Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution.[6]\n\nSenate\nIn contrast, the Senate is made up of two senators from each state, regardless of population. There are currently 100 senators (2 from each of the 50 states), who each serve six-year terms. Approximately one-third of the Senate stands for election every two years.\n\nIf a vacancy occurs, the state governor appoints a replacement to complete the term or to hold the office until a special election can take place.[7]\n\nSeparate powers\nThe House and Senate each have particular exclusive powers. For example, the Senate must approve (give \""advice and consent\"" to) many important presidential appointments, including cabinet officers, federal judges (including nominees to the Supreme Court), department secretaries (heads of federal executive branch departments), U.S. military and naval officers, and ambassadors to foreign countries. All legislative bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. The approval of both chambers is required to pass all legislation, which then may only become law by being signed by the president (or, if the president vetoes the bill, both houses of Congress then re-pass the bill, but by a two-thirds majority of each chamber, in which case the bill becomes law without the president's signature). The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in the Constitution; all other powers are reserved to the states and the people.\n\nThe Constitution also includes the Necessary and Proper Clause, which grants Congress the power to \""make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers\"". Members of the House and Senate are elected by first-past-the-post voting in every state except Louisiana and Georgia, which have runoffs, and Maine and Alaska, which use ranked-choice voting.\n\nImpeachment of federal officers\nMain article: Federal impeachment in the United States\nCongress has the power to remove the president, federal judges, and other federal officers from office. The House of Representatives and Senate have separate roles in this process. The House must first vote to impeach the official. Then, a trial is held in the Senate to decide whether the official should be removed from office. As of 2023, three presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump (twice). None of the three were removed from office following trial in the Senate.[8]\n\nCongressional procedures\nArticle I, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives each chamber the power to \""determine the rules of its proceedings\"". From this provision were created congressional committees, which do the work of drafting legislation and conducting congressional investigations into national matters. The 108th Congress (2003–2005) had 19 standing committees in the House and 17 in the Senate, plus 4 joint permanent committees with members from both houses overseeing the Library of Congress, printing, taxation, and the economy. In addition, each house may name special, or select, committees to study specific problems. Today, much of the congressional workload is borne by the subcommittees, of which there are around 150.\n\nPowers of Congress\nMain article: Article One of the United States Constitution\n\nThe United States Capitol, the seat of government for Congress, the legislative branch of the U.S. government\nThe Constitution grants numerous powers to Congress. Enumerated in Article I, Section 8, these include the powers to levy and collect taxes; to coin money and regulate its value; provide for punishment for counterfeiting; establish post offices and roads, issue patents, create federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court, combat piracies and felonies, declare war, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, make rules for the regulation of land and naval forces, provide for, arm and discipline the militia, exercise exclusive legislation in the District of Columbia, regulate interstate commerce, and to make laws necessary to properly execute powers. Over the two centuries since the United States was formed, many disputes have arisen over the limits on the powers of the federal government. These disputes have often been the subject of lawsuits that have ultimately been decided by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nCongressional oversight\nMain article: Congressional oversight\nCongressional oversight is intended to prevent waste and fraud, protect civil liberties and individual rights, ensure executive compliance with the law, gather information for making laws and educating the public, and evaluate executive performance.[9]\n\nIt applies to cabinet departments, executive agencies, regulatory commissions, and the presidency.\n\nCongress' oversight function takes many forms:\n\nCommittee inquiries and hearings\nFormal consultations with and reports from the president\nSenate advice and consent for presidential nominations and for treaties\nHouse impeachment proceedings and subsequent Senate trials\nHouse and Senate proceedings under the 25th Amendment if the president becomes disabled or if the office of the vice president falls vacant\nInformal meetings between legislators and executive officials\nCongressional membership: each state is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D.C.) in the House of Representatives. Each state is allocated two senators regardless of its population. As of January 2010, the District of Columbia elects a non-voting representative to the House of Representatives along with American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\nExecutive branch\nSee also: Article Two of the United States Constitution and List of United States federal executive orders\n\nJoe Biden\n46th president\n\nKamala Harris\n49th vice president\nsince January 20, 2021\nPresident\nMain articles: President of the United States and Powers of the president of the United States\n\nThe seal of the president of the United States\n\nThe White House includes the office of the U.S. president, known as the Oval Office, and the offices of key presidential advisors and staff.\nExecutive powers and duties\nThe executive branch is established in Article Two of the United States Constitution, which vests executive power in the president of the United States.[10][11] The president is both the head of state (performing ceremonial functions) and the head of government (the chief executive).[12] The Constitution directs the president to \""take care that the laws be faithfully executed\""[11] and requires the president to swear or affirm to \""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\""[13] Legal scholars William P. Marshall and Saikrishna B. Prakash write of the Clause: \""the President may neither breach federal law nor order their subordinates to do so, for defiance cannot be considered faithful execution. The Constitution also incorporates the English bars on dispensing or suspending the law, with some supposing that the Clause itself prohibits both.\""[14] Many presidential actions are undertaken via executive orders, presidential proclamations, and presidential memoranda.[15]\n\nThe president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[11][16] Under the Reception Clause, the president is empowered to \""receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers\""; the president has broad authority to conduct foreign relations, is generally considered to have the sole power of diplomatic recognition,[11][17] and is the United States' chief diplomat,[17] although the Congress also has an important role in legislating on foreign affairs,[11][17] and can, for example, \""institute a trade embargo, declare war upon a foreign government that the President had recognized, or decline to appropriate funds for an embassy in that country.\""[17] The president may also negotiate and sign treaties, but ratifying treaties requires the consent of two-thirds of the Senate.[18]\n\nArticle II's Appointments Clause provides that the president \""shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States\"" while providing that \""Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\""[19] These appointments delegate \""by legal authority a portion of the sovereign powers of the federal government.\""[20]\n\nThe Constitution grants the president the \""Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment\""; this clemency power includes the power to issue absolute or conditional pardons, and to issue commute sentences, to remit fines, and to issue general amnesties.[21] The presidential clemency power extends only to federal crimes, and not to state crimes.[22]\n\nThe president has informal powers beyond their formal powers. For example, the president has major agenda-setting powers to influence lawmaking and policymaking,[23] and typically has a major role as the leader of their political party.[24]\n\nElection, succession, and term limits\nFurther information: United States presidential election\nThe president and vice president are normally elected as running mates by the Electoral College; each state has a number of electoral votes equal to the size of its Congressional delegation (i.e., its number of Representatives in the House plus its two senators). (The District of Columbia has a number of electoral votes \""equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State\"").[10][25] A President may also be seated by succession. As originally drafted, there was no limit to the time a President could serve, however the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, originally limits any president to serving two four-year terms (8 years); the amendment specifically \""caps the service of a president at 10 years\"" by providing that \""if a person succeeds to the office of president without election and serves less than two years, he may run for two full terms; otherwise, a person succeeding to office of president can serve no more than a single elected term.\""[26][27]\n\nVeto power, impeachment, and other issues\n\nUncle Sam, a common personification of the U.S. federal government, depicted in an early 20th century illustration\nUnder the Presentment Clause of Article I, a bill that passes both chambers of Congress shall be presented to the president, who may sign the bill into law or veto the bill by returning it to the chamber where it originated.[28] If the president neither signs nor vetoes a bill \""within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him\"" it becomes a law without the president's signature, \""unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return in which Case it shall not be a Law\"" (called a pocket veto).[28] A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress vote to override the veto;[28] this occurs relatively infrequently.[29]\n\nThe president may be impeached by a majority in the House and removed from office by a two-thirds majority in the Senate for \""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\"".\n\nThe president may not dissolve Congress, but has the power to adjourn Congress whenever the House and Senate cannot agree when to adjourn; no president has ever used this power.[14] The president also has the constitutional power to, \""on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them\""; this power has been used \"" to consider nominations, war, and emergency legislation.\""[14] This Section invests the President with the discretion to convene Congress on \""extraordinary occasions\""; this special session power that has been used to call the chambers to consider urgent matters.[14]\n\nVice president\nMain article: Vice President of the United States\n\nSeal of the vice president of the United States\nThe vice president is the second-highest official in rank of the federal government. The vice president's duties and powers are established in the legislative branch of the federal government under Article 1, Section 3, Clauses 4 and 5 as the president of the Senate; this means that they are the designated presiding officer of the Senate. In that capacity, the vice president has the authority (ex officio, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College. As first in the U.S. presidential line of succession, the vice president's duties and powers move to the executive branch when becoming president upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president, which has happened nine times in U.S. history. Lastly, in the case of a Twenty-fifth Amendment succession event, the vice president would become acting president, assuming all of the powers and duties of president, except being designated as president. Accordingly, by circumstances, the Constitution designates the vice president as routinely in the legislative branch, or succeeding to the executive branch as president, or possibly being in both as acting president pursuant to the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Because of circumstances, the overlapping nature of the duties and powers attributed to the office, the title of the office and other matters, such has generated a spirited scholarly dispute regarding attaching an exclusive branch designation to the office of vice president.[30][31]\n\nCabinet, executive departments, and agencies\nMain articles: Cabinet of the United States, United States federal executive departments, and List of federal agencies in the United States\nArticle II, Section 2 of the Constitution sets forth the creation of a presidential Cabinet. The role of the Cabinet is to advise the president and carry out the programs and laws of the federal government. The Cabinet is composed of the vice president and the leaders of 15 executive departments. Those executive departments are the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security.[32]\n\nAdditionally, there are seven other members of the Cabinet who are appointed by the president. These are the White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management & Budget, United States Trade Representative, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[33]\n\nThe heads of the 15 departments are chosen by the president and approved with the \""advice and consent\"" of the U.S. Senate. Once confirmed, these \""Cabinet secretaries\"" serve at the pleasure of the president.\n\nIn addition to the executive departments, a number of staff organizations are grouped into the Executive Office of the President (EOP), which was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[33] The EOP is overseen by the White House Chief of Staff. The EOP includes the White House staff, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nOutside of the EOP and the executive departments are a number of independent agencies. These include the United States Postal Service (USPS), NASA, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, there are government-owned corporations, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.\n\nJudicial branch\nMain article: Federal judiciary of the United States\nFurther information: Supreme Court of the United States\nSee also: Article Three of the United States Constitution\nThe Judiciary, under Article III of the Constitution, explains and applies the laws. This branch does this by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases.\n\nOverview of the federal judiciary\n\nSeal of the U.S. Supreme Court\nArticle III section I of the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court of the United States and authorizes the United States Congress to establish inferior courts as their need shall arise. Section I also establishes a lifetime tenure for all federal judges and states that their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office. Article II section II establishes that all federal judges are to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate.\n\nThe Judiciary Act of 1789 subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into judicial districts and created federal courts for each district. The three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of the national judiciary: the Supreme Court, 13 courts of appeals, 94 district courts, and two courts of special jurisdiction. Congress retains the power to re-organize or even abolish federal courts lower than the Supreme Court.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decides cases and controversies, which include matters pertaining to the federal government, disputes between states, and interpretation of the United States Constitution, and, in general, can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as unconstitutional, nullifying the law and creating precedent for future law and decisions. The United States Constitution does not specifically mention the power of judicial review, which is the power to declare a law unconstitutional. There have been instances in the past where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches. Below the U.S. Supreme Court are the United States Courts of Appeals, and below them in turn are the United States District Courts, which are the general trial courts for federal law, and for certain controversies between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state, known as diversity jurisdiction.\n\nThere are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction, which are courts that handle both criminal and civil suits between individuals. Other courts, such as the bankruptcy courts and the U.S. Tax Court, are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases, known as subject matter jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Courts are supervised by the district courts, and, as such, are not considered part of the Article III judiciary. As such, their judges do not have lifetime tenure, nor are they Constitutionally exempt from diminution of their remuneration.[34] The Tax Court is an Article I Court, not an Article III Court.[35]\n\nThe district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are considered under the Judicial Code (Title 28, United States Code) consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of federal question jurisdiction, diversity jurisdiction, and pendent jurisdiction can be filed and decided. The district courts can also hear cases under removal jurisdiction, wherein a case brought in a state court meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, and one party litigant chooses to \""remove\"" the case from state court to federal court.\n\nThe United States Courts of Appeals are appellate courts that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts, and some direct appeals from administrative agencies, and some interlocutory appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts, and in addition has original jurisdiction over a few cases.\n\nThe judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, an Act of Congress; a U.S. treaty; cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls of foreign countries in the U.S.; cases and controversies to which the federal government is a party; controversies between states (or their citizens) and foreign nations (or their citizens or subjects); and bankruptcy cases (collectively \""federal-question jurisdiction\""). The Eleventh Amendment removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant. It did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant.\n\nThe power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress, and to criminal cases arising under federal law. The interplay of the Supremacy Clause and Article III has resulted in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts. Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law, and a handful of federal claims are primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts. Both court systems have exclusive jurisdiction in some areas and concurrent jurisdiction in others.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office \""during good behavior\""; in practice, this usually means they serve until they die, retire, or resign. A judge who commits an offense while in office may be impeached in the same way as the president or other officials of the federal government. U.S. judges are appointed by the president, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Another Constitutional provision prohibits Congress from reducing the pay of any present Article III judge. However, Congress is able to set a lower salary for all future judges who take office after such a pay reduction is passed by Congress.\n\nRelationships between state and federal courts\nSeparate from, but not entirely independent of, this federal court system are the court systems of each state, each dealing with, in addition to federal law when not deemed preempted, a state's own laws, and having its own court rules and procedures. Although state governments and the federal government are legally dual sovereigns, the Supreme Court of the United States is in many cases the appellate court from the State Supreme Courts (e.g., absent the Court countenancing the applicability of the doctrine of adequate and independent State grounds). The Supreme Courts of each state are by this doctrine the final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state's laws and Constitution. Many state constitution provisions are equal in breadth to those of the U.S. Constitution, but are considered \""parallel\"" (thus, where, for example, the right to privacy pursuant to a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy, and the asserted ground is explicitly held to be \""independent\"", the question can be finally decided in a State Supreme Court—the U.S. Supreme Court will decline to take jurisdiction).\n\nA State Supreme Court, other than of its own accord, is bound only by the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of federal law, but is not bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the federal circuit in which the state is included, or even the federal district courts located in the state, a result of the dual sovereigns concept. Conversely, a federal district court hearing a matter involving only a question of state law (usually through diversity jurisdiction) must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits, a result of the application of the Erie Doctrine; however, at the same time, the case is heard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence instead of state procedural rules (that is, the application of the Erie Doctrine only extends to a requirement that a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply substantive state law, but not procedural state law, which may be different). Together, the laws of the federal and state governments form U.S. law.\n\nBudget\nMain article: United States federal budget\n\nFederal revenue and spending of the U.S. federal government as of 2021\n\nThe financial ratio of federal debt to federal revenue from 1996 through 2022\nThe budget document often begins with the president's proposal to Congress recommending funding levels for the next fiscal year, beginning October 1 and ending on September 30 of the year following. The fiscal year refers to the year in which it ends.\n\nFor fiscal year (FY) 2018, the federal government spent $4.11 trillion. Spending equalled 20.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), equal to the 50-year average.[36] The deficit equaled $779 billion, 3.8 percent of GDP. Tax revenue amounted to $3.33 trillion, with receipt categories including individual income taxes ($1,684B or 51%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,171B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($205B or 6%).[36]\n\nEmployees\nMain article: United States federal civil service\nThe United States federal government had about 2,096,000 civilian employees in FY2016, with about 173,000 of those in the District of Columbia (not counting the United States Postal Service).[37]\n\nElections and voting\nMain article: Elections in the United States\n\nDiagram of the Federal Government and American Union in 1862\nSuffrage, known as the ability to vote, has changed significantly over time. In the early years of the United States, voting was considered a matter for state governments, and was commonly restricted to white men who owned land. Direct elections were mostly held only for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislatures, although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied from state to state. Under this original system, both senators representing each state in the U.S. Senate were chosen by a majority vote of the state legislature. Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, members of both houses of Congress have been directly elected. Today, U.S. citizens have almost universal suffrage under equal protection of the laws[38] from the age of 18,[39] regardless of race,[40] gender,[41] or wealth.[42] The only significant exception to this is the disenfranchisement of convicted felons, and in some states former felons as well.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the representation of U.S. territories and the federal district of District of Columbia in Congress is limited: while residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and federal taxes, their only congressional representative is a non-voting delegate; however, they have participated in presidential elections since March 29, 1961.[43]\n\nResidents of Puerto Rico other than federal employees do not pay federal personal income taxes on income that has its source in Puerto Rico,[44][45] and do not pay most federal excise taxes (for example, the federal gasoline tax);[45] however, Puerto Ricans pay all other federal taxes, including the federal payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare; the FUTA tax; and business, gift, and estate taxes.[45][44] Puerto Rico is represented in the Congress by a nonvoting Resident Commissioner, a nonvoting delegate.[46]\n\nState, tribal, and local governments\nMain articles: State governments of the United States, Tribal sovereignty in the United States, and Local government in the United States\nUnited States\nThe states of the United States as divided into counties (or, in Louisiana and Alaska, parishes and boroughs, respectively). Alaska and Hawaii are not to scale and the Aleutian and uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have been omitted.\nState governments have the greatest influence over most Americans' daily lives. The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the Constitution; as a result, states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals within their jurisdiction. Because state governments are not authorized to print currency, they generally have to raise revenue through either taxes or bonds. As a result, state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts or raise taxes any time the economy is faltering.[47]\n\nEach state has its own written constitution, government and code of laws. The Constitution stipulates only that each state must have, \""a Republican Government\"". Therefore, there are often great differences in law and procedure between individual states, concerning issues such as property, crime, health and education, amongst others. The highest elected official of each state is the Governor, with below him being the Lieutenant Governor. Each state also has an elected state legislature (bicameralism is a feature of every state except Nebraska), whose members represent the voters of the state. Each state maintains its own state court system. In some states, supreme and lower court justices are elected by the people; in others, they are appointed, as they are in the federal system.\n\nAs a result of the Supreme Court case Worcester v. Georgia, American Indian tribes are considered \""domestic dependent nations\"" that operate as sovereign governments subject to federal authority but, in some cases, outside of the jurisdiction of state governments. Hundreds of laws, executive orders and court cases have modified the governmental status of tribes vis-à-vis individual states, but the two have continued to be recognized as separate bodies. Tribal governments vary in robustness, from a simple council used to manage all aspects of tribal affairs, to large and complex bureaucracies with several branches of government. Tribes are currently encouraged to form their own governments, with power resting in elected tribal councils, elected tribal chairpersons, or religiously appointed leaders (as is the case with pueblos). Tribal citizenship and voting rights are typically restricted to individuals of native descent, but tribes are free to set whatever citizenship requirements they wish.\n\nThe institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically counties, municipalities, and special-purpose districts, which make laws that affect their particular area. These laws concern issues such as traffic, the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals. A county is an administrative or political subdivision of a state, while Louisiana and Alaska have county-equivalent subdivisions called parishes and boroughs, respectively. The specific governmental powers of counties vary widely between the states, with those in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and some parts of Alaska and Massachusetts having little or no power, existing only as geographic distinctions. In other areas, county governments have more power, such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies. Twenty states further divide their counties into civil townships. Population centers may be organized into incorporated municipalities of several types, including the city, town, borough, and village. These municipal entities also vary from state to state, and typically subordinate to the government of a county or civil township. However, many rural and suburban regions are in unincorporated areas that have no municipal government below the county or civil township level. Certain cities have consolidated with their county government to form consolidated city-counties, or have been legally separated from counties altogether to form independent cities. States may also create special-purpose districts that perform a single function or a set of related functions within an area inside one or more counties or municipalities, like school districts, water management districts, fire management districts, and library districts.\n\nSee also\nPresident\nExecutive Office\nLine-item veto\nCourts\nDistrict courts\nFederal courts\nFederal judicial circuit\nLaw\nU.S. Code\nAgencies\nFederal agencies\nflag\tUnited States portal\nicon\tPolitics portal\nStates and territories\nPolitical divisions\nU.S. territory\nWorks and websites\nBusiness.gov\nCopyright status of work by the U.S. government\nUSA.gov\nNotes\n The U.S. Government Publishing Office specifies the capitalization of Federal Government, in regards to the national government of the United States, as a proper noun.[1]\nReferences\n \""3\"" (PDF).
